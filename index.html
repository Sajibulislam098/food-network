                <h2>Instant Pot Beef Chili</h2>
                <p>A piping-hot pot of chili – no matter what the regional style – is a great remedy for a tiring day. This instant pot beef chili is super simple to make, and you can add or subtract any ingredients to your liking, including modifying the
                    spice level. Not only is it flavorful and low-maintenance, but it also makes a large serving size, so you can enjoy leftovers that will be just as good the next day. </p>

                <h2>Tomato Basil Soup</h2>
                <p>Silky tomato soup is nostalgic and fuss-free. Pair it with a simple grilled cheese sandwich for a comforting lunch or dinner. The savory flavors of roasted garlic and fresh basil and a sprinkle of salty parmesan cheese are what make this
                    made-from-scratch soup rich and deeply satisfying. To make this recipe vegan-friendly, simply substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and when it’s time to add the cream, either omit it completely or add a splash of coconut
                    milk.

                <h2>Steak Fajitas</h2>
                <p>To make this restaurant favorite at home, marinate a skirt steak in lemon juice, olive oil, fresh garlic and Worcestershire sauce before you cook it on a sizzling grill top. These steak fajitas are best served with sauteed peppers and
                    onions and warm flour tortillas. Of course, don’t forget the pico de gallo and guacamole. </p>
